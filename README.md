tl:dr ðŸ‘‰ *This repo is a fork of https://www.npmjs.com/package/notion-astro-loader*

I couldn't get the `notion-astro-loader` npm package to work by including it as a dependency in my `package.json`. It looks like the `dist` directory was missing from the published npm package. This repo adds the `dist` directory (and the build assets inside it).
